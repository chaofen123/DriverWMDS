# WMDS.net

## Introduction

We developed a weighted MDS network model (WMDS.net) to find the drive nodes of differential gene co-expression networks. WMDS.net integrates the degree of nodes in the network and the significance of gene co-expression difference between two physiological states into the measurement of node controllability of the transcriptional network. To confirm its validity, we applied WMDS.net to the discovery of cancer driver genes in RNA-seq datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas. WMDS.net is robust and powerful among various cancer datasets and outperformed the other top-tier tools with a better balance between precision and recall. 

## Gene_Net

Gene_Net is the hub network of intersection of gene interaction network constructed in Dawnrank[1] and the genes in TCGA.
